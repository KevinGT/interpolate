# interpolate

This repository is the code developed from week 2 of the PGCert. 

It now works in instantiating 2 objects linIntrpA and linIntrpB.

Test class instantiates the above objects and then runs the referenceTest method which calls the interpolate method in the LinearInterpolator class

Items to note:

1. watch the type declaration in object instantiation and in constructor variable declaration.

2. you only need to declare the type once.
